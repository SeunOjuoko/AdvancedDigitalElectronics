Finished Parsing XDC File [H:/Digital Electronics/Lab5/Lab5/Constraints/basys_3_constraints_full.xdc]
INFO: [Project 1-236] Implementation specific constraints were found while reading constraint file [H:/Digital Electronics/Lab5/Lab5/Constraints/basys_3_constraints_full.xdc]. These constraints will be ignored for synthesis but will be used in implementation. Impacted constraints are listed in the file [.Xil/AHBLITE_SYS_propImpl.xdc].
Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/AHBLITE_SYS_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.
